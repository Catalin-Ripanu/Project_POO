# RPG-Adventure-Game
Designed a Complex RPG based game using Java and JSON files for storing accounts used for logging in the game.

Implemented a functionality which allows the player to choose between 2 game formats (GUI and CLI).

If GUI format is desired, the player can choose between a randomly generated map or a fixed map.

Defeat enemies, increase your level and your damage, earn gold, buy potions from shops and be victorious!

The goal of the game is to find the final cell in the given map (each cell has it's own story).
