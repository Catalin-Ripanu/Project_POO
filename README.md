# Project_POO

- Designed a Complex RPG based game using Java and JSON files for storing accounts which are used for logging in.

- Implemented a functionality which allows the player to choose between 2 game formats (GUI and CLI).

- If GUI format is desired, the player can choose between a randomly generated map or a fixed map.

- The goal of the game is to find the final cell in the given map (each cell shows its own story on GUI as you progress).

- Note that the project structure is in IntelliJ IDEA format. In order to run this app, you'll need to install it [1]
